## Funds project
This is my first full-stack "big" project, so please don't be very judgemental, which begun as a project to get free pass for a subject in my academy.
Since I did pass the subject wihtout giving in project, I decided to develop it just for sake of my development and improvement of my programming skilss.

# Used technologies and sources of data
Project's using basic free acces to the Polygon.io'd base of stocks to get data, 
Microsoft SQL Server, ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework for a backend purposes 
and
Blazor with eventual using of ApexChart.js library for frontend purposes

# Objectives
To create modern, maybe decent application that will allow users to subscribe on Stocks (maybe comment them or just discuss something)
